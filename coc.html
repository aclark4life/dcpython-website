                            DC Python is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members of local DC Python communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger DC Python community of users and developers through events or interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Harassment includes but isn't limited to offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, Slack or IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any DC Python event, or expulsion from mailing lists, chats, discussion boards and other electronic communication channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from DC Python Meetup group membership.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of the DC Python community, Slack or IRC chat admins, website admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of DC Python. You may also email board@dcpython.org to report harassment or other violations of this policy, including enforcement felt to be excessive. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will be recused from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
